Golang bindings to Videocoin protocol
=========================================

Code is generated from [Videocoin protocol in solidity](https://github.com/videocoin/protocol).

To compile bindings you need to have `abigen` and `solc` binaries in your PATH.
Alternatively you can run generator that will use dockerized versions of those binaries:

```
make dockerized
```
